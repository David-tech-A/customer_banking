# Customer Banking System Project

## Introduction

In this project, you'll be creating a **customer banking system** that allows users to calculate and track interest earned on savings and CD accounts. By running this application, users will be able to enter their savings and CD account information, see the interest earned, and view the updated balances after a specified number of months.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:
- To understand the basics of **Python programming**.
- To learn how to handle **user input** and **output**.
- To work with **dictionaries** and **loops**.
- To perform **file handling** for data storage.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**: Users can create an account and log in.
2. **Account Management**: Users can add savings and CD accounts.
3. **Interest Calculation**: The system calculates interest based on the account type and balance.
4. **Balance Update**: Users can view updated balances after a specified number of months.

## Implementation

### User Authentication

```python
def create_account(username, password):
    # Code to create a new user account
    pass

def login(username, password):
    # Code to authenticate user
    pass'''
